## Overview
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Object detection.ipynb`) for performing object detection on images using a pre-trained deep learning model. The notebook leverages popular libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and NumPy to detect objects within an image and visualize the results directly within the notebook.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook to run the `.ipynb` file. You can install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

3. **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is required to run the object detection model. Install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

4. **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and visualization. Install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

5. **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

6. **Matplotlib**: Required for displaying images and results in the notebook. Install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

7. **Pre-trained Model**: Download a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., SSD, Faster R-CNN) and place it in the appropriate directory. You can get pre-trained models from the [TensorFlow Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).

8. **Label Map**: Ensure you have a label map file that maps object IDs to human-readable labels.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Download the Pre-trained Model**:
   Download a pre-trained model from the TensorFlow Model Zoo and extract it to the project directory. For example:
   ```
   ./models/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28/
   ```

3. **Label Map**:
   Ensure you have a label map file (e.g., `label_map.pbtxt`) that corresponds to your model. Place it in the appropriate directory, such as `./data/`.

4. **Open the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook using:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Object detection.ipynb"
   ```
   This will open the notebook in your default web browser.

## Usage

1. **Load the Notebook**:
   Open the `Object detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Configure the Notebook**:
   - Modify the paths to the model and label map file as needed.
   - Ensure that the `image_path` variable points to the image you want to process.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially. The notebook will:
   - Load the pre-trained model.
   - Load the input image.
   - Perform object detection on the image.
   - Display the image with detected objects and their labels.

4. **Visualize Results**:
   The notebook will display the input image with bounding boxes around detected objects and labels indicating the detected object classes.

## Notebook Structure

- **Cell 1**: Imports required libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Cell 2**: Configures the model path, label map path, and loads the pre-trained model.
- **Cell 3**: Loads and preprocesses the input image.
- **Cell 4**: Performs object detection and post-processing.
- **Cell 5**: Visualizes the results with bounding boxes and labels on the image.

## Error Handling

- The notebook includes basic error handling to check for the existence of the model and label map files.
- If an error occurs, an appropriate message will be displayed in the notebook output.

## Customization

- **Model**: You can change the pre-trained model by updating the path to the model directory in the notebook.
- **Threshold**: Modify the detection threshold in the notebook to control the sensitivity of object detection.
- **Image Path**: Change the `image_path` variable to test different images.
